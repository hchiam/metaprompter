# metaprompter

This is just an example. You'll need to put in your openai api key or update the script to read from your env vars. More than likely most people will just integrate this into their own code base.

Usage: 

Just pass your prompt as a string like this:
`python3 metaprompter.py "your prompt here"`

And it will run your prompt through the gpt-4 meta prompter and then to gpt-4 directly.
